# Server-Projects
This repository contains two networking projects; a server/client project and a peer to peer one. Both are written in Java.

## How Does it Work?
### Server/Client
1. Run the Server Class
2. Run the Client and connect to the server
3. Swap messages betweeen the two

### P2P
1. Run both Classes in two different terminal windows
2. Swap messages from one terminal to the other
